> Minica is a simple CA intended for use in situations where the CA operator also operates each host where a certificate will be used. It automatically generates both a key and a certificate when asked to produce a certificate. It does not offer OCSP or CRL services. Minica is appropriate, for instance, for generating certificates for RPC systems or microservices.
